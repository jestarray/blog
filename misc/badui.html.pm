◊h2{Windows 10}
Modern ux/ui design is obscuring a lot of information that could be very useful for diagnosing problems which leads to a lot of wasted time. The Windows loading circle for example is it:

◊oi{
    ◊li{Is it stuck forever loading?}
    ◊li{Did it crash? if so why?}
    ◊li{Is there an error code I can lookup?}
}

◊h2{Visual Studio 2019}

WHAT FILE WAS IT?!

Not to harp on Windows but I notice a lot of things have gradually shifted to giving less and less useful information over time and I don't know why. Is it because it would scare the end user?

◊h2{Gimp}

◊img[#:src "https://www.gimp.org/release-notes/images/2.10-icon-themes.png" #:style "max-width: 100%; height: auto;"]{}

In gimp, the default icon theme is now the bottom left, all grey. I see color first, then icons. If I need the eraser, I just look for pink. Now I have to squint sometimes to look for it, especially gets harder when my blue light filter cranks up.. It was fine before.


◊h2{Firefox}

Firefox's new "proton ui" removed the sound indicator for the tab that is playing music making it INCREDIBLY hard to find tabs.

I could go on and on but I think you get the point.

"If it ain't broken, don't fix it" rings much true for UX/UI design more than anything so please for the love of god,

Please stop pointless UI re-designs. 
Please stop the "minimalism" trend/asethetic of obscuring information.
Please just stop.
